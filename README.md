## test_natural

This is a few demos where I am testing out a node.js project called [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) which is a helpful little project that has to do with text analyses.

## Install

I will likely never publish this or anything like it to npmjs so just clone and install from here using git and npm.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_natural
$ npm install
```
